<p>
There is nothing inherently corrupt in offering Ukraine the service of
finding money that has been siphoned away from the Ukraine by corrupt
former officials. That service, done honestly, could be well worth
the price Ukraine pays for it, if it leads to Ukraine's recovery of a
substantial fraction of that money.
<p>
However, for Giuliani to offer that service to Ukraine while serving
as the conman's lawyer while the conman shakes Ukraine down is a
corrupt combination &mdash; in effect, a secondary shakedown.

Mice are not endangered, so I think we should proceed with the

gulls are not worth the trouble of saving), but this work will be
needed just once. If we succeed in eradicating the mice from any of

<p>
Micah Sample, a student at Indiana Wesleyan University, <a target="_top" href="https://reason.com/2019/11/26/indiana-wesleyan-micah-sample-cultural-appropriation/">was harshly
punished for publishing a statement rejecting the idea that "cultural
appropriation" is something to be condemned</a>.
<p>
One of the comments pointed out that the article errs in describing
his statement as "trollish". He stated his sincere views, not
a phony provocation.
<p>
I've stated <a target="_top" href="https://stallman.org/archives/2018-jul-oct.html#17_August_2018_(Racial_censorship)">similar views</a> and I stand by them. Culture exists for everyone to appropriate,
because that is how culture develops. It is as harmful for an ethnic
group to own a cultural practice as it is for Disney to own one.
<p>
This is not to say that there is no such thing as an offensive
statement. Obviously, a statement or gesture can mock or insult
people, and it is normal for the targets to take offense at this.
Harsh mockery and insults are unkind, and can get to the point of
being nasty.
<p>
However, the issue at hand is the claim that incorporating elements
from some other cultural group into your statement or gesture is not
merely unkind but a violation of their rights, and that this is
regardless of the intended meaning.
<p>
There is an inherent risk in borrowing or "appropriating" elements
from a culture you don't know well: that of displaying your ignorance
or looking like a fool. (The same things can happen with other
microsubcultures in your own culture.) Don't blame anyone else if you
make such a mistake. But we should let people live those mistakes
down.

<p>
Senate Democrats have introduced a data privacy bill which begins, though
just barely, <a target="_top" href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/26/expert-says-senate-democrats-sweeping-online-privacy-bill-answers-public-demand">to limit collection of some data</a>.
<p>
But it has obvious loopholes. It won't require companies to reveal
the conclusions they have deduced from the personal data they have
access to &mdash; because they argue that those are not "the client's
data." It won't, as far as I can see, limit the targeted ads that are
the basis for surveillance capitalism.
<p>
And it won't even try to make it possible to buy something over the
internet anonymously. <a target="_top" href="https://taler.net">We have the technology for this</a>.
<p>
The most sensitive personal data about you are where you go during the
day, what you do there, who you talk with, and what what you and they
say. It should be illegal to set up or operate a system <a target="_top" href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">which systematically collects any of those data, except when authorized
by a court order targeted at specific people</a>.

item to the store for you to buy later, in exchange for an ordering
fee paid in advance.

<p>
The "Contract for the Web" aims to protect privacy, but its privacy rules
are inadequate &mdash; <a target="_top" href="https://contractfortheweb.org/principles/principle-3-respect-and-protect-peoples-fundamental-online-privacy-and-data-rights/">similar to the European Union's GDPR</a>.
<p>
There are cities in Europe and the US that require motorists to enter
the car's license plate number to pay for parking. Cities say they
chose this method because it is efficient &mdash; but its byproduct is to
impose an additional system of massive surveillance on a large fraction
of the population.
<p>
The most sensitive data about you are your daily activities: where you
go, what you do there, and who you talk with. Machine learning can
deduce many important things about you from these data. It can identify
dissidents, whistleblowers, and journalists.
<p>
It is useless to try to prevent abuse of these data with rules about
using them. <a target="_top" href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/surveillance-vs-democracy.html">Personal data, once collected, <em>will</em> be misused</a>. Businesses and states will push to misuse them, and China shows
where that will lead.
<p>
Thus, adequate rules to protect privacy must ensure nobody collects
these data about you except <a target="_top" href="/articles/real-privacy-laws.html">under a court order that specifies you</a>.
<p>
In particular, adequate rules would clearly prohibit using massive
surveillance to collect parking fees. So we can judge any proposed
rules by checking whether they would certainly prohibit that.
<p>
The Contract for the Web offers no certainty of this, so it is not
adequate.

The private companies that own the UK electric and water grids have

You might suppose that a "gang enhancement" is intended to make a gang

California have their sentences increased in this way, <a target="_top" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/26/california-gang-enhancements-laws-black-latinos">but generally
it happens only to blacks and Hispanics</a>.

<p>
What <a target="_top" href="/glossary.html#perse">perse</a> will do is make sure that Rasmusen cannot grade students
based on bigotry, and that no student is required to take his classes.
<p>
I think this is the right way to deal with such situations.
Apparently Rasmusen's bigotry is extreme and unmistakable, but anyone
can make statements in which someone else will detect some sort of
stereotype, and could then be denounced as "racist" or "sexist".
It is right, it is crucial, to discourage bigotry without a witch hunt.

The bullshitter is trying to distract attention from his shakedown of

senators that there was no such thing: rather, <a target="_top" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/politics/ukraine-russia-interference.html">Putin is trying to
pin his own interference on Ukraine</a>.

of 2016, that would be entirely irrelevant to the issue of the shakedown.

<p>
This may well be corruption in the narrowest moral sense; campaign

broader sense of corruption: even in the absence of an outright bribe,
the power of the rich corrupts Democracy. This meeting is certainly
a part of that.

There is a deeper fault in Black Friday: it focuses people's attention

(Though some of them are full of proprietary malware <a target="_top" href="https://gnu.org/malware/proprietary-surveillance.html">which may spy on users</a>, or <a target="_top" href="https://gnu.org/malware/proprietary-drm.html">restrict them with DRM</a>, and nobody should buy those.)

Should Congress investigate the conman's practice of <a target="_top" href="https://act.demandprogress.org/sign/trump-navy-secretary/">pardoning

<p>
Pardoning them was wrong &mdash; war crimes call for punishment, and the US
usually fails to try the perpetrators.
<p>
Whether a politically controversial pardon should be grounds for
impeachment is a different question. I think a president ought to
pardon whistleblowers and journalists, including Edward Snowden and
Julian Assange. That too is politically controversial. Should a
president be impeached for pardoning them?
<p>
Should Governor Altgeld have been impeached for pardoning the union
leaders wrongly convicted of the Haymarket bombing? (Their "trial"
didn't try to prove they had anything to do with it.) He was quite
unpopular after pardoning them, but the act was not treated a crime.
